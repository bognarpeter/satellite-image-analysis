## Abstract
The main goal of this research project is to implement and evaluate an effective method to detect and classify urban areas, land covered by buildings, and other man-made structures on synthetic-aperture radar imagery. The best performing solution is a neural network-based model with U-net architecture, which is able to do binary image segmentation on the image tiles. As a result of the research, I deliver a model implementation that successfully identifies urban areas on the provided satellite images.

## Deployment

1. Clone the repository  
2. Create a conda environment and activate it (Optional)  
`conda create -y -n interdisc python==3.9.0`  
   `conda activate interdisc`  
3. Navigate to the repository  
`cd path/to/interdisc`  
4. Install dependencies  
`conda install -r requirements.txt`  
5. Run model.py to train a model  

## Data
The data, used for the work is provided by a high-resolution sensor system of the European Space Agency, backed by its Sentinel-1 satellite mission and it covers the region of Innsbruck. The data was provided by the university and it is not publicly available!

The data, used by the model is pre-processed by the `preprocess.ipynb` script and the masks for urban areas are created by the `create_masks.ipynb` script. The pre-processed data can be regenerated by simply running the scripts.
